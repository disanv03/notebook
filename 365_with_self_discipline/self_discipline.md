# 356 with self discipline

**I don't want an easy life, I want a beautiful life**

Day 1:


> Be easy when you live it the hard way... and hard if you try to live it the easy way.

> Seek out and welcome challenges as opportunities to grow. Each [challenges] strenghtens them, so that fewer and fewer difficulties in life overwhelm them.


Day 2:


> When you make the same wrong choice several times in a row, it becomes your standard


> Each time you're faced with a decision between exerting self-discipline and taking it easy, remind yourself that the choice you're making today doesn't affect the present moment alone. A momentary decision can reverberate for many years, or even decades into the future.
