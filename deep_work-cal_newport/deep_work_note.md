Email is a  wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; mu role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration."

As his son Francis later remembered, he would rise promplty at seven to take a short walk. He would then eat breakfast alone and retire to his study from eight to nine thirty. The next hour was dedicated to reading his letters from the day before, after which he would return to his study from ten thirty until noon. After this session, he would mull over challengin ideas while walking on a proscribed route that started at his greenhouse and then circled a path on his property. He would walk until satisfied with his thinking then declare his workday done."
