> "... The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration."

> "I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I'd used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is a  wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; mu role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration."

> "Those who deploy the bimodal philosophy of deep work admire the productivity of the monastics but also respect the value they receive from the shallow behaviors in their working lives..."

> "*Charles Darwin* had a similarly strict structure for his working life during the period when he was perfecting **On the Origin of Species**. As his son Francis later remembered, he would rise promplty at seven to take a short walk. He would then eat breakfast alone and retire to his study from eight to nine thirty. The next hour was dedicated to reading his letters from the day before, after which he would return to his study from ten thirty until noon. After this session, he would mull over challengin ideas while walking on a proscribed route that started at his greenhouse and then circled a path on his property. He would walk until satisfied with his thinking then declare his workday done."

> "People play differently when they're keeping score"

> "...set out to prove that some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle"

> "When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done"

> "Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you'll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slighest hint of boredom."

> "Deep work habit requires training, ..., this training must address two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction."

> "Don't take breaks from distraction. Instead take breaks from focus."

> "When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back."

> "You must be on your guard for looping, as it can quickly subvert an entire productive meditation session. When you notice it, remark to yourself that you seem to be in a loop, then redirect your attention toward the next step."

> "Notice that this craftman approach to tool selection stand in opposition to the any-benefit approach. Whereas the any-benefit mind-set identifies any potential positive impact as justification for using a tool, the craftman variant requires that these positive impacts affect factors at the core of what's important to you and that they outweigh the negatives."

> "Part of what fueled the social media's rapid assent, I contend, is its ability to short-circuit this connection between the hard work of producing real value and the positive reward of having people pay attention to you."
> "I'll pay attention to what you say if you pay attention to what I say-regardless of its value."
> "This agreement gives everyone a simulacrum of importance without requiring much effort in return."

> "Put more thought into your leisure time" *Arnold Bennett*

> "Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities"

> "Schedule every minute of your day"

> "It's a simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your day and ask: "What makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?" It's the habit of asking that returns results, not your unyielding fidelity to the answer.

> "... Because, of course, in the end, a business's goal is to generate value, not to make sure its employees' lives are as easy as possible."
